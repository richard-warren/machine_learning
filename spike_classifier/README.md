# spike_classifier

Early on in grad school I used electrode arrays to record neural activity in the [dorsal cochlear nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsal_cochlear_nucleus) of mice. I often found [cartwheel cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartwheel_cell), a mysterious cell type that fires two distinct types of action potentials with unknown function.

Here is a little 1D-convolutional classifier that separates so called 'simple spike' and 'complex spike' action potentials. It worked surprisingly well with very little effort.
